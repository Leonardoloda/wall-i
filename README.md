# wall-i

## Description

Just a simple app to create a new robot, to make it easier to verify; I've decided to add both apps into the same repo. 

## Server

For the backend, I've created a simple node application with just one endpoint to create a robot. More info [here](./server/README.md)

## Webapp

For the frontend, I've used React + Typescript to create a simple form inspired by old consoles. More info [here](./webapp/README.md)
